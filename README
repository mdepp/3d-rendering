Description:
	Implements a software renderer in C++, which was more of an experiment than an effort to produce anything usable. Supports light (with specular highlights), object colours (at least in theory), but not textures.

	It was built in Visual Studio Community 2017 using vcpkg for dependency management.

Dependencies:
	Assimp
	GLM
	SDL2
	SDL2_image
